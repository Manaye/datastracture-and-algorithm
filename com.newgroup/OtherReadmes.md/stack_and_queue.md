# Stacks and Queues

Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node,
and a pointer to the next node andCreate a Stack class that has a top property
It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
Create a Queue class that has a top property. It creates an empty queue when instantiated.

## Challenge

* writhing a method called push which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node
with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.
* writhing a method called pop that does not take any argument,
removes the node from the top of the stack, and returns the node.
* writing  a method called peek that does not take an argument and
returns the node located on the top of the stack.

## Approach & Efficiency

the run time or BIG O of this is O(1)and space O(1)
## API

1. Stack
1. Queue
1. peek
